# mcp-proto

This repository contains the Model Context Protocol (MCP) implementation, which enables Large Language Models (LLMs) to securely access external data sources and APIs. The project includes:

- **[mcp-crowdstrike-server](./mcp-crowdstrike-server/)**: A server implementation that connects to CrowdStrike's Falcon API, allowing LLMs to access security intelligence and threat data.

The MCP framework facilitates structured communication between AI models and external tools, providing a standardized way for LLMs to retrieve real-time information, perform actions, and access specialized knowledge.
